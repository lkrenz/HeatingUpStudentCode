| January 16 | 6:00-6:30 | I spent this time thinking through the problem and trying to come up with a solution. I've come up with a very basic naive approach, just iterating through the arrary and then searching through every node immediately following it. While this approach seems pretty inneficient, on the order of n squared, the small size of temperatures <10000 would make this not prohibitively large. I also came up with a perhaps more efficient approach. You do one search through and you label all of the temperature points you used in that search. You then move forward from the point you started at until you reach a node with a lower start value than the node you started at. You then repeat the linear search, labeling every node you use and repeat. |

It turns out I was thinking about the problem wrong, you can't just do a linear search through and determine the best order no matter what node you start at. To fix this, I came up with a recursive solution that, at every node, compares the case of adding it, if possible, and not adding it and returns the best option. This should work but I need to debug it. |
