| January 16 | 6:00-6:30 | I spent this time thinking through the problem and trying to come up with a solution. I've come up with a very basic naive approach, just iterating through the arrary and then searching through every node immediately following it. While this approach seems pretty inneficient, on the order of n squared, the small size of temperatures <10000 would make this not prohibitively large. I also came up with a perhaps more efficient approach. You do one search through and you label all of the temperature points you used in that search. You then move forward from the point you started at until you reach a node with a lower start value than the node you started at. You then repeat the linear search, labeling every node you use and repeat. |

It turns out I was thinking about the problem wrong, you can't just do a linear search through and determine the best order no matter what node you start at. To fix this, I came up with a recursive solution that, at every node, compares the case of adding it, if possible, and not adding it and returns the best option. This should work but I need to debug it. |

There were two errors in the code. From the start my solution was always returning 0 and it took me far to long to realize that I just wasn't calling the code I had written. Once I put the method call in for my naiveSolution to call naiveHelper, my code started returning values that were far too high. This happened becasue I was mixing up max and streak in my base case. I changed this and my code started working. I need to fix stack overflow error to get code to run in test efficient large. |
| January 16 | 7:30-8:00 |                                                                                                                                 During this time, I started to think of ways to get around the stack overflow error. The best solution that I've come up with is using a queue and an iterative approach to run through the temperatures. The recursive solution feels more elegant in that it returns a single value. But I found a way to get this way to work by changing how the base case works. In this solution, everytime a data point reaches the end of temperatures, it adds its streak to an array list that I can do a linear search through later. I can also set this up so it just compares against a current maximum and then keeps the maximum. |
